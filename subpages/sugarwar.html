                            <h2>Description</h2>
                            <p>Game was created during <b>TK Jam 2023</b> during less than 2 days in Unreal Engine 5 blueprints. 
                                That was the first almost full game for the all of us as a team. 
                                Now I will dive into details. Technical description will be divided into two important parts: player related solutions and the second one, enemy related.</p>
                            <h3>Player</h3>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="../gifs/memoGame/flip_card.gif" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Here I made code to controll player, add collisions and attack collision.
                                Also there had to be adjusted looks and animations depending on the actions taken. </p>

                            <p><br><br>Below is an image of perhaps the most difficult part, creating cards that cover the screen symmetrically with respect to a point in the center of the screen.</p>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="../gifs/memoGame/big_size.gif.gif" alt="" /></span>
                            <h3>Enemy</h3>

                            <p>In this game all of the enemies (2) use the same blueprints for actioms, Behavior Tree and Animations. I will show the most interesting parts below. 
                            </p>
                            <!-- <span class="image main"><img src="../gifs/sugarWar/player_around.png" alt="" /></span> -->
                            <p>Starting with the most important part, the Behavior Tree. 
                                It is divided into 3 main parts: <b>Attack</b>, <b>Chase</b> and <b>Patrol</b>.

                                Each of them is equally important, so let's start with <b>Attack</b>.
                                <br><br><b>Attack</b> is called whenever the cooldown for it refreshes and the player is in the hit range. Then the AI performes an animation.
                                This animation has Draw Sphere and Apply Damage embeded on specific frame of animation, which allows the player to dodge the attack.

                                <br><br><b>Chase</b> is called whenever the player is in the chase range. Then the AI is chasing the player with the speed of 600.
                                
                                <br><br><b>Patrol</b> is called whenever the player is not in the chase range. Then the AI is patrolling between two points with the speed of 300.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Key takeouts</h3>
                            <p>I have learned how math is important in games. Choosing the places of things may be really pain without some spatial imagination. 
                                Another thing is Game Manager, how to make it accessible everywhere in the code, how to communicate different scripts with it. 
                                And the last but not least thing is the place in the code and way of operating of Game Objects that are already unnecessary, that you can't just delete or deactivate it, sometimes you need to do some adjustments before you proceed with that.</p>
